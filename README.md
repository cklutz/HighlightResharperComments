# HighlightResharperComments
Visual Studio Extension that highlights ReSharper "disable" and "restore" comments with a color you can choose.

The idea is that you can select a color (go to Options/Environment/Fonts And Colors/Highlight ReSharper Comments)
that "faint" in comparison to the standard comment color, so that those "// ReSharper disable InconistentNamming",
etc. comments don't stick out so much.
